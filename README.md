# Text-to-Speech-using-Python

Hey guys!
Welcome to my first project which I have created using python.

Just a heads up for everyone to download the following python packages before running the code!
1. tkinter
2. pyttsx3

Also, please download ffmpeg from the link (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and the latest version of python (From Microsoft Store, and run the program using that)

Thank you!
